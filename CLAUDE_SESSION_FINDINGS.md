# Session Findings - Search Fix & Modal Upgrade

## Search Functionality Fix
**Problem**: Keystroke-by-keystroke search on Users page broke after ~1.5 seconds when moving mouse
**Root Cause**: Aggressive DOM element cloning in `attachRowClickListeners()` was replacing elements user was interacting with
**Fix Applied**: 
- Replaced DOM cloning approach with smart listener attachment using data attributes
- Added check for `row.dataset.listenerAttached === 'true'` to prevent duplicate listeners
- Increased debounce delay from 100ms to 400ms for slow connection environments

**Files Modified**:
- `D:\Projects\Repos\Oaks-Village\Members\Areas\Identity\Pages\Users.cshtml`

## Bootstrap Modal Delete Confirmation
**Problem**: Original modal implementation broke delete functionality 
**Root Cause**: Incorrect form action construction - was trying to create new form instead of using existing form
**Fix Applied**:
- Modified modal confirmation to use existing `editForm` and append `?handler=Delete` to action
- Simplified approach by modifying existing form action instead of creating new form
- Proper modal hide sequence before form submission

**Files Modified**:
- `D:\Projects\Repos\Oaks-Village\Members\Areas\Identity\Pages\EditUser.cshtml`

**Code-behind Handler**: `OnPostDeleteAsync()` method on line 263 of `EditUser.cshtml.cs`

## Key Technical Notes
1. ASP.NET Core maps `handler=Delete` to `OnPostDeleteAsync` method automatically
2. DOM event listener management requires careful tracking to avoid interference
3. Modal implementations should leverage existing form structures when possible
4. Debounce timing should account for connection speed variations

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing delete confirmation at controller level for better UX
- Monitor search performance with large datasets
- Evaluate need for progressive enhancement fallbacks
