# Oaks Village HOA Management System - Project Status

## Project Overview
Multi-tenant HOA management system with shared codebase across multiple communities:
- **Primary Project**: Oaks-Village (D:\Projects\Repos\Oaks-Village)
- **Sister Projects**: Hoa-Cloud, Fish-Smart (same underlying framework)
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 9.0 MVC with Razor Pages, Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap 5

## Recent Major Accomplishments

### 1. More Links Dynamic System (COMPLETED ✅)
**Purpose**: Dynamic link management for community resources with role-based access
**Implementation**:
- Models: `LinkCategory.cs`, `CategoryLink.cs` 
- Controller: `LinksController.cs` (full CRUD with Admin/Manager authorization)
- Views: Complete responsive UI with Bootstrap styling
- Database: Seeding with default categories and links
- Navigation: Integrated into Welcome dropdown (below Galleries)

**Key Features**:
- Role-based visibility (Admin-only categories)
- Drag-drop sorting capability
- Modal-based editing
- Responsive design

### 2. Search Functionality Crisis Resolution (COMPLETED ✅)
**Problem**: Keystroke-by-keystroke search broke after ~1.5 seconds on Users page
**Root Cause**: Aggressive DOM cloning in `attachRowClickListeners()` replacing active elements
**Solution Applied**:
- Replaced DOM cloning with smart listener attachment using `data-listenerAttached` flags
- Increased debounce from 100ms to 400ms for slow connections
- Fixed in `Users.cshtml` around lines 400-500

**Files Fixed**: 
- `D:\Projects\Repos\Oaks-Village\Members\Areas\Identity\Pages\Users.cshtml`

### 3. Bootstrap Modal Delete Confirmation (COMPLETED ✅)
**Enhancement**: Upgraded EditUser delete from simple confirm() to fancy Bootstrap modal
**Implementation**:
- Professional modal with warning icons and member details
- Proper form submission using existing `editForm` with `?handler=Delete`
- Modal handles `OnPostDeleteAsync()` method correctly

**Cross-Project Compatibility**: ✅ Verified and copyable to Hoa-Cloud and Fish-Smart

## Current Framework State

### Database Schema
- **Core Identity**: ASP.NET Identity tables
- **UserProfile**: Extended user information (address, phones, billing contact)
- **LinkCategory/CategoryLink**: Dynamic links system
- **Roles**: Admin, Manager, Member hierarchy

### Key Pages Architecture
- **Users.cshtml**: Real-time search, pagination, role management
- **EditUser.cshtml**: User profile editing with fancy delete confirmation
- **Links/**: Complete CRUD for link management (Admin/Manager only)
- **MyBilling.cshtml**: Billing contact history

### Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based access control (Admin > Manager > Member)
- Two-factor authentication support
- Email/phone confirmation workflows

## Technical Patterns Established

### Search Implementation
```javascript
// Debounced search with smart event listener management
const searchDebounceDelay = 400; // Optimized for slow connections
row.dataset.listenerAttached = 'true'; // Prevents duplicate listeners
```

### Modal Confirmations
```javascript
// Standard pattern for form handler submission
editForm.action = currentAction + separator + 'handler=Delete';
editForm.submit();
```

### Role Authorization
```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")] // Controller level
User.IsInRole("Admin") // View level
```

## Cross-Project Maintenance Notes

### Shared Components
- EditUser pages are identical across projects ✅
- Users search functionality standardized ✅
- Bootstrap/CSS frameworks aligned ✅
- Authentication patterns consistent ✅

### Project-Specific Variations
- Environment variables for default city/state/zip
- Database connection strings
- Email sender configurations
- Individual community branding

## Environment Setup
```
Working Directory: D:\Projects\Repos\Oaks-Village
Additional Projects: D:\Projects\Repos\Oaks-Village, D:\Projects\Repos\Hoa-Cloud, D:\Projects\Repos\Fish-Smart
Git Status: Clean (master branch)
Platform: Windows
Framework: ASP.NET Core 9.0
```

## Future Maintenance Considerations

### Common Updates Needed
1. When updating EditUser, copy to all 3 projects
2. Search functionality improvements apply universally
3. Authentication/authorization changes need cross-project sync
4. Bootstrap component upgrades require testing across all projects

### Project Management Tips
- Use Oaks-Village as primary development/testing environment
- Verify cross-compatibility before rolling out to sister projects
- Maintain shared documentation for common patterns
- Test role-based features across different user types

## Session Files Created/Modified
- `CLAUDE_SESSION_FINDINGS.md` - Technical issue resolution details
- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_STATUS.md` - This comprehensive status document
- `MORE_LINKS_DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE.md` - Original deployment specifications
- Multiple view and controller files for More Links system
- Fixed Users.cshtml search functionality
- Enhanced EditUser.cshtml with Bootstrap modal

## Next Session Priorities
- Test More Links system functionality across all roles
- Verify search performance with larger datasets
- Consider additional UI/UX enhancements based on user feedback
- Monitor for any regression issues in updated functionality
